Not done:
* Generating images for Math - it can be done, but MathJax seems good enough
* Fine-tune:
** Restructure tex-source to remove tables
** More text per page?
** Move pre-amble to separate style-file
** Listings (I might have manually added one line in ltx-listing.css)
** Finer splitting?

Known issues in LaTexML:
* Nested emph does not work 
* Processing result of latexdiff (but doesn't seem important)
* Different handling of nameref (worked around)

2a. LatexML distribution:

      Update LatexML-maybeMathJax.js as in https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML/blob/d0332d5955b04e69abb52fc93a3d99b1282aa724/lib/LaTeXML/resources/javascript/LaTeXML-maybeMathjax.js

Pro:
* Underlying LaTeX-format is stable
* Predictable and clearly visible separation between structure and text
* Straightforward to adapt using user-commands, e.g. for references
* Great math-support

Con:
* LaTeXML is slightly limited variant of LaTeX
* More time to get started (mostly done)
